3. Run the application (preferably with Visual Studio or Xcode)

## Features and Functionalities
This OpenGL application contains a simple virtual scene consisting of 5 models. The 5 models are placed on a 100x100 square grid. Each model consists of the 3rd letter of the name and 4th digit of the student ID of the team member who created it. Each model were transformed using scaling, rotation, and translation. The user can select any of the models using the keys 1-5, and apply transformations using the controls listed below.
